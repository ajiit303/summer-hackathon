# 🏆 Gold Rush: Predicting the 2024 Olympics Champion 🏅

## 🌟 Overview
Welcome to Gold Rush! 🌟 We are on an exhilarating journey to predict the champion of the 2024 Paris Olympics. Using the comprehensive Olympic Summer & Winter Games dataset (1896-2022), our interactive visualization tool lets users explore past champions and predict future winners. Click on an event (e.g., basketball) and unveil the historical champions, statistical graphs, and our predictions for who will win gold, silver, and bronze in 2024! 📊✨

## 🤟 Features
- Interactive Visualization Tool: Dive into past champions and future predictions with a simple click! 🖱️
-Statistical Graphs: Beautiful and insightful graphs to visualize historical data and predictions. 📈
-Event-Specific Insights: Select an event and see detailed statistics and predictions. 🏀🏊‍♀️🏃‍♂️

## 🚀Tech Stack

We are leveraging the power of **Python** and a host of libraries to bring this project to life:

- **tkinter**: For building our user-friendly GUI. 🎨
- **pandas**: To handle and manipulate our extensive dataset. 🗃️
- **re**: For data cleaning and preprocessing. 🧹
- **plotly.express** & **plotly.io**: To create stunning, interactive plots. 🌐
- **Linear Regression**: Perfect for predicting outcomes based on historical data trends. 📈

## 💼 How It Works

We use **Linear Regression** to predict the outcomes based on historical data trends. Our tool is designed to provide a seamless and engaging experience, making it easy for users to explore and understand the predictions. 🧩🔍
